        Swami Vivekananda was a great philosopher, Hindu monk, and spiritual
        leader who believed in the mantra of simple living and high thinking. He
        was born on January 12 in a traditional Bengali family in Kolkata. Swami
        Vivekananda moved the world with his discourse of modern Vedanta and Raj
        Yoga at a very early age. He was well-versed in all Hindu scriptures
        like Ramayana, Geeta, Mahabharata, Vedas, and Upnishads. He had a
        profound knowledge of multiple subjects like History, Bengali
        literature, Sanskrit, and so on. Inspired by Sri Ramakrishna, Swami
        Vivekananda embraced him as his guru and embarked on his spiritual and
        philosophical journey to enlighten the world. He established the
        Ramakrishna Mission to provide aid to the poor and distressed. Swami
        Vivekananda introduced the western people to Indian culture,
        spirituality, philosophy, the practice of meditation, and Hindu
        religion. He got global recognition following his famous speech in
        Chicago. He left the world on the 4th of July, 1902 while meditating.
